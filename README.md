rubydoo
=======
rubydoo is a rails app that helps you find the right dog for your lifestyle, and searches for Fido based on your location. After being asked a series of questions, the top 10 dog breeds for your lifestyle will be listed.  With the input of your zipcode rubydoo will then search for dogs similar to your top 10 in local adoption centers and shelters.

## Reason for This Project ##

As well as helping rescue dogs become adopted, this app is built to showcase my skillset as a developer based on the curriculum set forth in the Nashville Software School 6 month program.

 - Answer a series of questions regarding your lifestyle and the type of dog you are looking for
